# GRADED FUNCTION: compute_cost

def compute_cost(A2, Y, parameters):
    """
    Computes the cross-entropy cost given in equation (13)

    Arguments:
    A2 -- The sigmoid output of the second activation, of shape (1, number of examples)
    Y -- "true" labels vector of shape (1, number of examples)
    parameters -- python dictionary containing your parameters W1, b1, W2 and b2
    [Note that the parameters argument is not used in this function,
    but the auto-grader currently expects this parameter.
    Future version of this notebook will fix both the notebook
    and the auto-grader so that `parameters` is not needed.
    For now, please include `parameters` in the function signature,
    and also when invoking this function.]

    Returns:
    cost -- cross-entropy cost given equation (13)
